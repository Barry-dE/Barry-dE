ðŸ‘‹ Hello! I am Barigbue Nbira, I'm a passionate software engineer and technical writer with a deep love for Cloud DevOps, Software Development, and Creative Development. I thrive in dynamic environments where I can merge my technical expertise with my creative mindset.

I embrace Agile/Scrum methodologies to deliver high-quality software solutions efficiently. I enjoy collaborating with cross-functional teams, fostering communication, and ensuring seamless integration between development and operations.

Beyond coding, I have a profound appreciation for photography, capturing moments that tell captivating stories through the lens. Exploring the intersection of technology and art fuels my creativity and inspires me.

In addition to my interest in photography, I am fascinated by the potential of Web3 technologies and the decentralized web.
